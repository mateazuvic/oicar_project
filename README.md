# oicar_project

This project was made by team of 3 people. We came up with the idea of digitizing memories using a traditional magnetic souvenir that would have a QR code on it. Through our mobile application the QR code can be scanned. Each user could fill in information about their trip, including pictures.

There is also demo video in demo folder.
